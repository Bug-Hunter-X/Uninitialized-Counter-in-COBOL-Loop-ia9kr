This repository demonstrates a common error in COBOL programming: uninitialized counters in loops. The `bug.cob` file contains code with the error, while `bugSolution.cob` provides the corrected version.  The error arises from not initializing the counter variable `WS-COUNTER` before the loop starts.  The solution demonstrates proper initialization to ensure the loop executes correctly.
